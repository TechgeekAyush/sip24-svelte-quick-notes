## Description of the project
- Developed as part of Summer Internship Program offered by Craftlab.
- The application provides the ability to add a note by mentioning the title and the details for the note.

- The application makes use of Dexie.js as the wrapper for IndexedDB for storing the notes instead of localStorage.
- Makes use of Tailwind CSS for responsiveness of the application.

## Introduction

We are excited to welcome you to the Svelte Fundamentals course, a key part of the Summer Internship Program 2024. In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of Svelte by building a simple note application. This project will help you understand the core concepts of Svelte while creating a functional quick notes app.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository specified for the Svelte projects.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch with your name.
4. Implement the quick notes app by following the tutorial.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request to the main repository.

### Additional Challenge
To enhance your learning experience and add more functionality to your project, we encourage you to take on the following challenges:
1. Add a feature to delete notes within the application.
2. Use IndexedDB for storing notes instead of local storage. For easier interaction with IndexedDB, consider using the Dexie.js library.

These challenges are designed to push your skills further and give you hands-on experience with more complex application features.
